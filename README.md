## Overview

This challenge is on building out a social proof section component and getting it to look as close to the design as possible.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the section depending on their device's screen size

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

One major learning point for me when doing this challenge was the the use of the media queries to make the page responsive. This helped me create a responsive mobile view for this challenge

### Continued development

I will like to- use the flexbox idea more in future projects so i can get a good grasp of how flexbox works entirely.
